## Flash Projector Bookmark Manipulator
So the [Linux version of the Flash Projector](https://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/32/flash_player_sa_linux.x86_64.tar.gz) has a bookmark option in the toolbar. This is pretty undocumented, so I hope this shows up in Google results. To add / remove things from the toolbar option, alter `~/.flashrc`.

A sample `~/.flashrc` would look like:
```HTML
<A HREF="https://linkto.swf">Link To</A>
<A HREF="https://linkto2.swf">Link To 2</A>
```
Check for updates for the projector from [Adobe's site](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html)
